Rough notes:

go over a declarative pod representation of quickstart app
  contains 1 pod

logs, exec, port forwarding

introduce service

overview pods, labels, selectors, and services

change pod to RC
discuss RC
scale pod up

introduce deployments
move everything under a deplyoment

update to new versions of our app, quick rolling update
 - lightweight here - more detail in "Advanced" module


## Prerequisites
